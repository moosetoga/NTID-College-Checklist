She also developed a technique to   train speech reception, called "tracking", that uses story-length   material and measures rate of verbatim transfer of text. In the area of   audition, she studies perception of the relative timing of speech events   (gap detection) and patterns of loudness growth in the presence of   hearing loss, and is in the process of refining judgments in assessing   hearing aid fit.

My current research interests include aesthetic theory, deaf studies,   disabilities studies, multimodal literacy, critical literacy, second   language development, globalization and critical pedagogy. My work in   second language development is an attempt to integrate the principles of   fine arts into the discourses on postmodern literacy by way of deaf   studies. Other topics that I find fascinating include teacher   intensification (overloading), multiliteracies, qualitative   research/ethnography, postmodernist/post-structural theory, and the uses   of communicative technologies within globalized societies with an   emphasis on critiquing of neoliberal educational policy.</p></td>

He is proud to be a part of the Black   ASL research team because the history and language of the   African-American Deaf Community deserves a closer look from the   scholarly perspective. He also published a book in 2012, Language   Attitudes in the American Deaf Community, which is a study of the   factors of judgments and attitudes expressed by deaf and hard-of-hearing   signers regarding the different types of signing that exist in the   American Deaf community.</p>

        <p>Dr. Hill was born and raised in Cincinnati, OH, in a family of deaf   and hard-of-hearing siblings and a hard-of-hearing mother. Like his   brothers and sisters, he attended public school as a mainstream student.   He is a very adventurous person who likes to try new and challenging   activities, such as Tough Mudders, Spartan, tasting unusual dishes, and   painting on a blank canvas. He is also a Spongebob Squarepants   aficionado.</p>
